Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category

A statically typed language is one in which the type of its variable is known at compile time, e.g Java, C++, C, Swift, Rust, Go, etc.

A dynamically typed language is one in which the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. e.g Python, Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, R, Dart, etc.

- 'Undefined' is a variable that has been declared but has not being assigned a value. e.g let undefinedVariable;
