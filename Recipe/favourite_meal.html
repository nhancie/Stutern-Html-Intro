    <h1>JOLLOF RICE AND CHICKEN</h1>
    <h3>The origin of Rice</h3>
    <p><b>Rice</b> is the seed of the grass species <i> Oryza sativa</i> or less commonly <i>Oryza glaberrima </i>. The name wild rice is usually used for species of the genera Zizania and Porteresia, both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of Oryza.</p>
    <p>Jollof (/dʒəˈlɒf/), or jollof rice, is a rice dish from <strong> West Africa</strong>. The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables and meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions.The Nigerian rice recipe discussed here is the classic Nigerian Jollof Rice prepared at parties. This is the most popular Nigerian rice recipe. This is why you will always see it in parties. It is quite easy to prepare if you follow the simple steps. </p>

        <h2>Directions to preparing the meal:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>After broiling your red bell pepper (tatashe), scotch bonnet pepper (Ata-rodo), onions, garlic and ginger; you blend. Then you put into a pot and boil till all the water is absorbed and you’re left with a thick paste.</p></li>
            <li><p>Now in this step, a lot of people advise not to parboil the rice but instead to get an easy cook rice as not parboiling allows the rice to spend more time in the stew base absorbing all the flavours, thereby intensifying it. But I wasn’t comfortable with the idea of not parboiling (so for the benefit of those of us that would still like to parboil), I read a tip from Dooney’s kitchen I found useful. You can pre-boil your rice before washing. You make sure all the cloudy water is on top and you’ve achieved that white colour you get from cooked rice...you also want it to be firm. You bring out the rice from the pot and run through cold water. You can then proceed to wash your rice.</p></li>
            <li><p>Meanwhile, You get your stainless steel pot and put in your cooking oil (I’m using olive oil, any choice of oil is fine) and butter. Sauté your onions till it’s fragrant and translucent.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add your tomato paste and stir while frying. You would want to fry till the oil bubbles through and is seen above the paste.</p></li>            
            <li><p>Add thyme, curry, paprika, white pepper. Keep stirring while frying ( we would like to get all the spices into the paste). Then, you add your blended tomato mix and a little of your beef/chicken stock (adding in bits is important, we don’t want our stew base to be too watery). After adding the stock, check for seasoning and add your salt, seasoning cube if needed.</p></li>            
            <li><p>We want our rice to soak up enough of our stew base. So first, take out a little of your stew base from the pot and then add your rice. Stir continuously till all the grains have been coated in the stew (you can add more of your stew base if it’s not enough). Then, add your stock or water to exactly the level of your rice.</p></li>            
            <li><p>Cover your pot and allow to cook in low to medium heat till all the liquid has been absorbed. This can usually take about 20-30mins. When there’s no liquid left, you add your Stubb’s mesquite liquid smoke in little quantity. This gives an added smoky flavour to your rice. Please, be careful not to go overboard with adding it to your rice.</p></li>            
            <li><p>
                Then cover your pot in a foil wrapper and close with a tight lid. Let the steam do the rest of the work. Now, one very efficient way to get that smokey smell and flavour ingrained in your jollof rice is allowing it to burn. So, turn up your heat to the highest and let it cook for about 5-8mins or till you smell that burn. You put off your heat.</p></li>
